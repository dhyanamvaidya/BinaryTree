BinaryTree
==========
There is no BinaryTree class available in java.util package out of the box. 
BinaryTrees and in specific BinarySearchTrees are at the heart of so many of
the core data structure implementations in all the programming languages.
It is of utmost importance to be fundamentally clear with Trees in order to 
understand other data structures which have been built on top of it. 

This implementation of BinaryTree can be used to understand the behavior of this 
recursively defined data structure. Trees can throw a curveball at the first time
learners because of its recursive nature. It can be a bit tricky to get your head
around initially, but be rest assured, once you start thinking recursively, you'll 
fall in love with it. :-)

Making a full fledged BinaryTree by manually linking various individual tree nodes can be a
pain in the neck. So here I have provided a special method which builds a tree from an easy
one line representation of it. See the parse(String) method for more detail.

This project can be forked by anyone who is learning this data structure for the first
time. Fork it, play with it, explore the behavior of different traversal, search and other
kinds of methods it has. Understand how it is working. Find bugs if you can and try to
solve them.

Important:
If you take inspiration from this codebase to solve your homework assignments, then do 
mention about this in your code. Taking cue from other's work is not a problem, but not 
acknowledging that fact is! :-)
